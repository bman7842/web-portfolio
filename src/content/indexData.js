Worked frequently with C, C++, assembly code, and data collection tools to analyze hardware behavior and engineer a solution. Heavy emphasis on signal processing concepts such as Goertzel’s formula and the fast fourier transform. Modernized the team’s hardware testing tools by redeveloping API and emphasizing reusability. Also assisted in creating custom C++ JSON parsing library for a product in development."
