A static personal portfolio site built with Gatsby.

## Deployment
*This site is currently hosted with Netlify!*


Gatsby makes local deployment easy. `npm run develop` will serve your site locally, and should even support auto-reload. Tailwindcss will automatically re-render the global css for the pages when changes are needed.

## Tools
I decided to use my personal portfolio as an excuse to explore the world of frontend web development. I wanted to document the new technologies I discovered and my thoughts on them.

### TailWindCSS
I had been excited to try tailwindcss for a while now and decided this project was a good excuse to give it a go. If I had to collect my brief thoughts on it, I'd say it is an amazing tool given the current state of most frontend frameworks. The functional styling tailwindcss so strongly promotes pairs well with the component based structure of React (and most of modern web development). Overall it is definitely a tool I plan to use with future projects!

### Gatsby
I'll be honest, I never wrote a README when I first started working on this site. At that time I was very inexperienced when it came to web development. However, writing this README today I have a new stance on things and much more experience in the field. I think Gatsby is a great tool, and overall fully competent. I am happy that I choose this framework for my portfolio website - the performance has been amazing! That being said, Gatsby just doesn't seem as loved as other frameworks such as NextJS, a tool I'm currently leverging for other projects. Gatsby excells with static sites, and technically is capable of server-side rendering, but so does NextJS. What Gatsby does great, NextJS does just as good from my experience, and often it extends upon Gatsby's features with other amazing utilities. If I were to redo this website, I think I would still use Gatsby, but for more complex projects I'm sticking with NextJS.
